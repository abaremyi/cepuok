ABOUT US – CEP UoK

CEP–UoK (Communauté des Étudiants Pentecôtistes à l’Université de Kigali) is a Christian students’ fellowship that brings together university students at the University of Kigali who desire to grow spiritually, live out their faith, and serve God within the academic environment.

CEP–UoK operates under the spiritual supervision of ADEPR Kimihurura International Service (Local Church) and functions in full compliance with the rules, policies, and regulations of the University of Kigali.

Our fellowship exists to nurture students spiritually, develop godly leadership, promote unity among believers, and impact both the university and the wider community through prayer, worship, discipleship, evangelism, and acts of love.

Although rooted in Pentecostal Christian values, CEP–UoK is open to all students of the University of Kigali, regardless of denominational background. Non-ADEPR students are welcome to fully participate in all activities, while leadership positions within the main governing committee are reserved for ADEPR members, in line with our governing constitution.

CEP–UoK functions as one fellowship with two main operational sessions:

Day Session

Weekend Session


Each session has its own working committee, but both operate under one central CEP–UoK leadership, working in unity, accountability, and shared vision.
