## 6. HISTORICAL EMPHASIS ON SELF-RELIANCE AND RESPONSIBILITY

From 2019 onwards, CEP–UoK leadership intentionally emphasized the importance of preparing members for life beyond university. During this period, CEP–UoK faced financial and structural challenges, largely due to unemployment among members and limited engagement in income-generating initiatives.

Leadership observed a mindset gap where job creation and economic participation were not always viewed as part of Christian responsibility. In response, CEP–UoK introduced continuous sensitization, starting with leaders, encouraging members to combine strong faith with practical responsibility.

This emphasis aligns with national youth empowerment programs that promote self-reliance and entrepreneurship. CEP–UoK envisions producing believers who are spiritually grounded, economically responsible, and socially impactful.
