Here we had this description as Mushya group while we were developing the website and it is here attached. we have again the membership page with member registration and login functionality which is working fine but we have to update it with some added information for example on registration form of member there is a requirement of knowing the program the member takes and the faculty again to add the church will not be the select option but the simple field a member might fill by his/her own. and also look inside the shared documentation add all necessary information because the records should be kept in the sense of session(Day, or Weekend) where we want to manage leadership portal wisely. The main focus now is to create the leadership portal, we start by Revising Authentication by user Session program[weekend, day]). to see if the information are separated accordingly. next we manage the user which is the super admin's privilege alone except he give some permission to another user. other users(leadership) are the registered members where their mandate takes only one year and they are replaced by other leaders and they continue from the closing of the old committee which is determined by the handover date.  because also the members registration module can be on the leaders side where they can add the other members and also super-admin can or other user who can be given a role to do so.

After that the super admin manage users and roles where roles to start with are (super-admin, President, Vice Pres1 Evangelism, Vice Pres2 Social Affair,  Accountant, Secretary, Advisor 1, Advisor 2, Advisor 3, Advisor 4 Choir President). after this also session management module is added in settings where super admin has rights to update also member session. and control accessibility levels where he may stop specific session from using the portal until super admin grants the authorization.

 Secondly we will continue with member management on the portal side by this member can be given a family or not (in Day Session we have three families[Bethesda Family, Naioth Family, Siloam Family], third we continue with supporters Management (CEP Supporters) after we are done with family module, fourth we continue with FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT module which is crucial and very big and the one we want more than anything, the fifth is DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS module management and after that comes sixth module choir management Module then seventh is project management then lastly we deal with reports
